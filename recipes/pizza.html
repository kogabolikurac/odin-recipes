        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Nothing beats homemade pizza night!</p>
        <p>This incredible pizza dough is easy to make and bakes to golden perfection for a crust that's crisp on the outside, and soft and pillowy on the inside. (If you're not a crust eater, that's about to change!)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Meats: Pepperoni, Hamburger, Sausage, Bacon, Ham, Buffalo Chicken, BBQ Chicken, Chicken Tenders, Grilled Chicken, Pulled Pork, Capicola, Salami, Meatballs.</li>

        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the yeast to a small bowl with sugar and warm water (105-115°). Cover with saran wrap and let it sit for 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, add half of the flour, salt, and garlic powder. Stir to combine. Add the yeast mixture, oil, and gradually mix in remaining flour. </li>
            <li>Knead for 3-5 minutes and transfer to a clean bowl. Cover with saran wrap and let rise until doubled by half, (30-60+ minutes), or overnight in the fridge. Gently punch it down and knead 5 times. Spread into a 12-inch circle and transfer to a preheated, floured pizza pan (or stone).</li>
            <li>Use a fork to poke holes in the crust to keep it flat while baking. Brush with olive oil, then top with sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with cheese and toppings. Bake in a preheated 450° oven for 13-15 minutes. Remove, slice, and serve!</li>
        </ol>
